# Hardware Lifecycle Management

## Objective
Define and document a structured approach to managing endpoint hardware throughout its lifecycle, from procurement to retirement.

---

## Lifecycle Stages
- Procurement
- Deployment
- Active Use
- Refresh
- Decommissioning

---

## Lifecycle Data Tracking
The following attributes are tracked for each endpoint:
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Serial number
- Purchase date
- Warranty expiration
- Vendor End-of-Life (EOL)

---

## Hardware Evaluation & Benchmarking
New hardware models are evaluated before approval to ensure compatibility, performance, and long-term support.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Performance and reliability benchmarks
- BIOS and firmware stability
- BitLocker and Secure Boot compatibility
- Driver support and update cadence
- Vendor lifecycle guarantees

---

## Governance
Approved devices are documented and maintained in a centralized hardware compatibility and approval matrix to ensure standardization and supportability.
